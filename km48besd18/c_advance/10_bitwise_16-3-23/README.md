1. Write a Macro's Set,clear and toggle n'th bit using bit wise operator?

2. WAP print binary?

3. WAP to count the bits set (bit value 1 ) in an integer? Find out and compare different possibilities?

4. WAP implement subtraction functionality with out using SUB('-') Operator.    

5. WAP implement addition functionality with out using ADD('+') Operator.   

6. WAP implement XOR functionality with out using XOR(^) operator.

7. WAP to implement the sizeof operation using bitwise operator.  

8. WAP to convert Little endian integer to Big endian integer 

9. WAP multiply a number by 9 using bit shift.

10. WAP whether a number is ODD or EVEN using bitwise.

11. WAP whether a number is power of 2 or not?

12. WAP print reverse of interger number? 

13. WAP Check if the 20th bit of a 32 bit integer is on or off?

14. Write a functionsetbits(x,p,n,y)that returns x with then bits that begin at position p set to the rightmost n bits of y, leaving the other bits unchanged.

e.g. if x = 10101010 (170 decimal) and y = 10100111 (167 decimal) and n = 3 and p = 6 then
you need to strip off 3 bits of y (111) and put them in x at position 10xxx010 to get answer
10111010. Your answer should print out the result in binary form although input can be in
decimal form.
Your output should be like this:
x = 10101010 (binary)
y = 10100111 (binary)
setbits n = 3, p = 6 gives x = 10111010 (binary).

15. WAP Swap any two numbers using bitwise operators. How it works?
