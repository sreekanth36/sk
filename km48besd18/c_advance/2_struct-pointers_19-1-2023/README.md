write all programs with main function in one file, and other functions in another source file. 

1) create an alias name for the structure and start using it. also create date of birth and date of joining as nested structure type members.

2) write a function to receive the structure as a call by reference argument, and read its data using scanf function. Print the data using a function, which receives the structure as a call by value argument.

3) Write a function to receive an array of structures as argument, and reads the data for all the elements using scanf. print the data using another function, that also receives the array as argument.

4) write swap function for 2 structures and swap their values.

5)send the array of structures as argument to a function, that will reverse the order of the array elements. use swap  function written above for swapping. print the array in main function.
