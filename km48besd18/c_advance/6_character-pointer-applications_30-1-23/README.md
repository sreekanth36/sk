1)implement your own string copy function.

try calling the string copy function by sending the below as input:

1) string constant as destination and string variable as source

2) string variable as destination and string constant as source

3) string variable as destination and string variable as source

4) string constant as destination and string constant as source

  note down the output and analyze the reasons.

2) Implement your own string compare function and try calling the function using two string constants as input arguments.

3) Implement your own string concatenation function.

try calling the string copy function by sending the below as input:

1) string constant as destination and string variable as source

2) string variable as destination and string constant as source

3) string variable as destination and string variable as source

4) string constant as destination and string constant as source

note down the output and analyze the reasons.

4) Write a swap function to swap the values of two character variables.

5) implement your own string reverse function using the above swap function to swap the edges while reversing.

try calling the string reverse function using

1) string variable

2) string constant

note down the output and analyze the reasons.

6) define a sizeof macro ,that will find the size of a given variable as parameter, using pointers.

7) try to send a character array / character pointer / string constant as arguments and see what is the size returned, and understand the difference./

8)define a sizeof macro ,that will find the size of a given data type as parameter. use pointers.
