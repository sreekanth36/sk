1)create a dynamic array of integers. Take input from user , sort the array and display the output.

2) Implement itoa function and return the string from the function. Print the result in main.

itoa function converts an integer into a string.

eg., input 123 , output : "123" (char pointer to "123")

declaration : char * itoa(int )

3) Write a function, that takes two strings as input and concatenates only the first n characters from first string and first m characters from second string and makes a new string.

eg., input str1 = "kernel masters", str2 = "raayan systems", n = 3, m = 5

output : kerraaya

4)  Write a program to read  n number of strings from a user and print which string is the smallest of all ( in string comparison, smallest string means that should come the first in dictionary sorting order). Create the strings dynamically and read the data.

 5)  read a set of numbers from the user, and convert each integer to string using itoa function that you have written above, and print the numeric string in calling function in the same loop.
