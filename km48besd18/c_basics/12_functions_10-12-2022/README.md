3)write a function that can take an integer as input and return 1, if the number is prime number and 0 if it is not prime and print appropriate output message.
return type is integer.
IsPrime - returns int (0,1)

4)Write a function that takes an integer parameter and prints its multiplication table.return type should be void.

5)Write a function to determine if a character is alphanumeric or not.
Hint: int fun_alpha_num(char c). 

eg., 5
character is numeric

eg., a

8)Write a function to accept a year as input and return 1 if the year is a leap year, otherwise returns  0.


9)Write a function to accept two dates as input arguments, and return 1 if the first date is older, 0 if the second date is older.
