1) Modify the calculator program - with functions ,Add(),Sub(),Mul(),Div(),Mod(). Each function should take the inputs as parameters and return the result as output.
Hint: int add(int , int);
int sub (int, int);

2)Write a function ,that can take two integers, swap their values and print their new values.return type should be void.

3)write a function that can take an integer as input and return 1, if the number is prime number and 0 if it is not prime and print appropriate output message.
return type is integer.
IsPrime - returns int (0,1)

4)Write a function that takes an integer parameter and prints its multiplication table.return type should be void.

5)Write a function to determine if a character is alphanumeric or not.
Hint: int fun_alpha_num(char c). 

eg., 5
character is numeric

eg., a
character is alphabet

eg., %
character is special character


6)Write a function that takes principle, rate of interest and time in months as input arguments, and returns the total amount to be repayed, after calculation of simple interest.


7)Write a function that takes two numbers, a and n as input arguments and returns the value of a to the power of n.


8)Write a function to accept a year as input and return 1 if the year is a leap year, otherwise returns  0.


9)Write a function to accept two dates as input arguments, and return 1 if the first date is older, 0 if the second date is older.


10)Write a function that accepts a month and year as input, and returns the number of days of the month as output. Print the number of days in a given month and year.

11)Write a program with a function that takes two integer arguments, and prints all prime numbers between those numbers using the prime number function written previously. return type should be void.
PrintAllPrimes - return type is void. Should use IsPrime()


12)Write a function that takes two numbers, a and n as input arguments and returns the value of a to the power of n.


13)Write a function to accept a date and validate the date. Return 1 if the date is valid, 0 if it is not valid.


14)Write a function to return the product of two numbers without using * operator.


15)Modify the calculator program - multiply, division and remainder functions to return the result without using the operators *, / and % respectively.


16)Write a power function ,that takes 2 numbers as input, and calculates power without using * operator.


17)"Write a function to accept a character as input, return the upper case character, if the given character is a lower case alphabet, otherwise return the character as it is.
char CaseReverse(char );"


18)Write a function to accept two dates as input arguments and return the difference in number of days.


19)Write a function to take a number and return the output of below series as output. Use factorial function (write your own) to calculate the factorial of the number in each term.

1 - 1/2! + 1/3! - 1/4! + 1/5! .... 1/n!


20) Write a function to return the nth term of a fibonacci series. using this function print the fibonacci series upto n terms.
