1.List out the data types, their format specifiers. 


2.try input and output on different variables ,create variables and then formatted output and inputs, print some expressions with arithmetic operations.


3.Calculation of simple interest.
steps:
1)declare 2 integer variables p and n to represent principle and duration in months respectively.
2)declare a floating point variable r to represent rate of interest.
3)declare a floating point variable si to store simple interest after calculation.
4)declare a floating point variable m to represent time duration in years.
5)print the following indicative message using printf
"please enter principle,time in months and rate of interest"
5)read the values of p ,n and r using scanf.
6)devide n by 12.0 using / symbol and store the result in m, to convert time duration from months to years.
Hint : m = n / 12.0;
7)calculate simple interest using the below formula and store in si variable.
si = p * m * r / 100;
8) print si value to the user using printf.


4.calculate average of 4 integer numbers and print the output.


5.calculation of area and perimeter of rectangle,square and circle in three different programs.


6.if sale price and profit of n items is given find the cost price of 1 item.
eg., number of items : 15
sale price of 15 items : 500
profit : 50
cost price of each item: 30
