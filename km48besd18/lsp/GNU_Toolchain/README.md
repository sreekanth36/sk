# Linux Development Enviornment ( GNU Tool Chain )


## GNU:

	GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix!", chosen because GNU's design is Unixlike, but differs from Unix by being free software and containing no UNIX code.
	GNU is an operating system and an extensive collection of computer software. 
	GNU is composed wholly of free software, most of which is licensed under the GNU Project's own GPL.

## GNU Tool Chain:

	The GNU toolchain is a broad collection of programming tools produced by the GNU Project.
	These tools form a toolchain used for developing software applications and operating systems.

	The GNU toolchain plays a vital role in development of Linux, some BSD systems, and software for embedded systems.

	1. GCC (GNU ‘C’ Compiler (or) GNU Compiler Collection)
	2. GDB (GNU Debugger) - a code debugging tool
	3. GNU make - an automation tool for compilation and build
	4. GNU Binutils - a suite of tools including linker, assembler and other tools
	5. GNU Build System – a configuraiton tool
